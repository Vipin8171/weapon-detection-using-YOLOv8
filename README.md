Weapon Detection using YOLO - Summary
Here's a structured summary of all the steps taken so far for weapon detection using YOLO:

1️⃣ Setting Up the Environment
Installed required dependencies (ultralytics, opencv-python).
Used Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for running the project.
2️⃣ Downloading the Dataset
Used Roboflow API to download a weapon detection dataset.
Verified that the dataset contained annotated images for training.
3️⃣ Training the YOLO Model
Selected YOLOv8 as the model architecture.
Trained a custom YOLOv8 model (best.pt) using Roboflow dataset.
Verified training logs, validation metrics, and loss curves.
4️⃣ Running Live Weapon Detection
Loaded trained YOLO model (best.pt) for inference.
Opened live webcam feed using OpenCV.
Applied real-time object detection on video frames.
Drawn bounding boxes around detected weapons.
5️⃣ Improving Detection & Fixing Errors
Fixed webcam errors (cv2.VideoCapture(0) issues).
Used cv2.imshow() for real-time frame display.
Ensured proper release of webcam (cap.release() & cv2.destroyAllWindows()).
Increased detection accuracy by setting a confidence threshold (> 0.5).
✅ Project Status: Working Real-Time Weapon Detection Model 🚀
🔹 Next Steps: Improve dataset quality, train for more epochs, test in real-world environments.
